# Modding

Replacement pads can be found on Aliexpress: [Sony MDR-ZX100 / V150 corrugated pads](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005005583913815.html?spm=a2g0o.order_list.order_list_main.50.769e1802N21afG) are a good substitute. Just cut the bottom lip and fix using double-sided tape. To protect the driver, small discs of acoustically neutral foam can be used to cover the pad holes.

Once pads are replaced damping is generally very easy: soft woolen or synthetic tissue seems to work well, one or two discs in the back are generally enough. Cotton pads as used in the Russian forum also work, but tend to reduce mids and raise highs too much for these headphones.

Disassembly is very easy: remove the silver outer rings rings, then flex the clips to slide the driver assembly out.

# Production variance

Relief on the side indicates production factory, as usual with Soviet-made headphones. Cable strain reliefs and markings are also different across production runs, and even inside the same factory.

## Leningrad factory

Smooth strain reliefs. "Stereo" markings on cup can be missing.

## Chișinău (Kishinev) factory

Different grilles, ridged strain reliefs, USSR logo before "Amfiton" marking can be replaced by dots, markings can be colored in gold.

# Sverdlovsk

Different markings on the cups, use of screws, seems related to [this model](http://www.lossy.ru/forums/showpost.php?p=26635&postcount=265) and be from the Sverdlovsk factory ([logo identification](http://www.lossy.ru/forums/showpost.php?p=26644&postcount=267)).

## Unidentified versions

No "stereo" relief on left side of cups, colored strain relief similar to the TDS-16/16 (indicative of Ukrainian manufacturing?).

# Measurements

Flat plate custom rig measurements using an Umik-1 microphone. Red = Leningrad version, Blue = Kishinev green version, Grey = Stax L500 as reference. Similar damping used on the two headphones but different materials, which could explain in part the minor differences in frequency response.
